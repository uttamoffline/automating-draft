# QA Strategy for trycentral.com

## Objective
As the first QA at trycentral.com, my primary goal is to establish a **practical and scalable QA foundation** that:
- Builds confidence in critical product flows.
- Fits naturally into the engineering workflow.
- Evolves into automation and CI/CD without slowing the team.

---

## Initial 2 Weeks: Understanding First
1. **Learn the Product**
   - Walk through the platform like an end-user.
   - Identify primary personas (e.g., agents, admins, customers).
   - Document the top 3–5 user journeys (chat intake, scheduling, CRM updates).

2. **Understand the Architecture**
   - Meet with engineers to map services (chat agent, CRM backend, integrations).
   - Identify dependencies (APIs, third-party tools).

3. **Know the Userbase & Business Priorities**
   - Collaborate with product managers to learn which features drive most usage.
   - Review analytics/feedback to understand pain points.

This ensures testing aligns with **how users actually use the product**.

---

## Tools & Processes (Best Practices)
- **Bug Tracking**: Jira for defect logging, triage, prioritization.
- **Communication**: Slack/Teams integration for bug/test notifications.
- **Test Documentation**: Lightweight Confluence or Notion space for test cases & QA notes.
- **Automation (Phase 1)**: Python + Pytest + Selenium/Playwright for UI, Requests for API.
- **CI/CD**: Start with GitHub Actions; migrate to Jenkins for parallel test execution as suite grows.

---

## Test Suite Structure
### Smoke Tests
- Minimal set: login, chatbot intake, CRM record creation.
- Goal: **quick confidence check** on every code push.

### Regression Tests
- Broader coverage: lead lifecycle, scheduling, permissions, dashboard states.
- Goal: **catch integration issues** before release.

**Execution Approach**
- Smoke suite runs on every commit.
- Regression runs nightly and before releases.
- Both suites start small and expand as product matures.

---

## Automation vs Manual Testing
- **Automate**:
  - Stable, repetitive, business-critical flows (chat → CRM, authentication).
  - API contract tests for backend services.
- **Manual**:
  - Exploratory testing for new features or unclear specs.
  - Usability, accessibility, and visual checks.
- **Prioritization**:
  1. Critical user journeys (blockers if broken).
  2. High-usage features (chat, dashboard).
  3. Medium-risk areas (permissions).
  4. Low-usage features (advanced analytics, rarely used options).

---

## Workflow & Pipeline Integration
- **Short-term (First 2–4 weeks)**
  - Establish Jira bug workflow.
  - Define initial smoke suite manually.
  - Integrate one automated smoke test into GitHub Actions.

- **Mid-term (1–3 months)**
  - Expand smoke suite (add CRM, scheduling).
  - Create regression suite with automation for stable flows.
  - Set up Jenkins with parallelization to keep runtime efficient.

- **Long-term (3–6 months)**
  - Broaden regression to cover edge cases.
  - Add performance testing for chat APIs.
  - Refine test data strategy for repeatable runs.

---

## QA Metrics & Reporting
At this early stage, focus is on **practical visibility**, not heavy benchmarking:
- Smoke/regression pass rate before release.
- Open defects vs resolved defects per sprint.
- Build health (pass/fail trends).

As the team grows, evolve to deeper quality metrics (coverage, flakiness, performance benchmarks).

---

## Communication & Collaboration
- **Daily standups**: QA updates + blockers.
- **Release readiness**: Smoke & regression summary shared with PM + Engineering.
- **Post-release review**: Track production issues to guide test improvements.

---

## Summary
The first phase of QA at trycentral.com is about **learning and building trust**:
- Understand the product, architecture, and userbase.
- Put in place lightweight processes for bugs and test documentation.
- Start small with smoke and regression suites, automate only stable flows.
- Integrate into CI/CD quickly, keeping runtime efficient.
- Grow QA into a reliable function that supports fast, confident releases.
